# User stories
Marketing research team - As a member of the marketing research team I want to figure out which products people like the most so I can know what to sell. I want to track the data to find what users like the best out of three images displayed at a time. I want the information gathered and stored in a list so it is easy to find what the user likes.


Developers - As a Developer I want to display three images at a time and let the user click on them. I want to keep track of how many clicks the user inputs so I can know when to stop the survey. I want to display the information gathered in a list or chart so the marketing team knows which products to sell.


Focus group participant - As a participant in the focus group I want a clear and easy way to go through the survey. I want a nice interface that is easy to look at and follow so I can provide my opinion. I want to see my answers displayed after I am finished choosing them so I can see what I answered to. I want a fun interactive experience instead of a boring plain survey.
